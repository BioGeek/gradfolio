I am Camila Duitama Gonz√°lez, and I work as a PhD Student in the [Sequence Bioinformatics](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/sequence-bioinformatics/) group from Institut Pasteur under the supervision of [Dr. Rayan Chikhi]() and [Dr. Hugues Richard](http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/hrichard/). I am currently working in the decontamination of ancient metagenomic data using machine learning applied to k-mer profiles.
