I am Camila Duitama Gonz√°lez, a PhD Student in the [Sequence Bioinformatics](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/sequence-bioinformatics/) group from Institut Pasteur under the supervision of [Dr. Rayan Chikhi](http://rayan.chikhi.name) and [Dr. Hugues Richard](http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/hrichard/). I am currently working in the decontamination of ancient metagenomic data using machine learning applied to k-mer profiles.

I did a MSc in Life Science Informatics at the Rhenish Friedrich Wilhelm University of Bonn and a B. Eng in Biological Engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

In my free time I listen and dance to [salsa](http://latinastereo.com) or read about [decolonial feminism](https://masp.org.br/uploads/temp/temp-vqwSWUGgIDVZXgPEXbvU.pdf)
