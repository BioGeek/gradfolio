Max Planck For Bology of Ageing - Bioinformatics Core Facility
------------
### 2018 and 2020 ###


I worked at the Bioinformatics Core Facility under the supervision of [Dr. Jorge Bouças](https://www.age.mpg.de/science/core-facilities/bioinformatics/service-leader)
as a Python developer Contributing in a flask-based app for biological research called [Flaski](https://flaski.age.mpg.de).
I totally recommend it if you come from a non-programming background and are interesting in plotting your biological data.

I also worked at the same Core Facility as a Research Assistant on a project
called *Expansion of a multi-organism Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network based on gene ontology annotations
and multiple PPI databases* that was presented at the Poster session of the [17th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) in 2018](http://eccb18.org/posters-2/)



Max Planck For Biochemisty - Computational Systems Biochemistry group
------------
### 2017 ###


I worked for several months under the supervision of [Dr. Jürgen Cox](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/cox) assisting on the bioinformatics core facility in NGS and proteomics data analysis.
